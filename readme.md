# WFCPROCGEN
this is an attempt to implement wave function collapse with unity.  
it's not very good and needs abstracted out.  

## Goals
- [x] implement basic wfc
- [x] (kind of done) generate new tilemaps from existing tilemaps
- [ ] generate new tilemaps in a boundary box around the camera (infinite generation)
- [ ] store generated tilemaps in some sort of data structure
- [ ] frustum culling to remove tilemaps that are too far away to see
- [ ] Get the fuck out of unity and implement this in C++
